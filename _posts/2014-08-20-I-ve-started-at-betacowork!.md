So, today, I've started to **cowork** with [Gus](https://be.linkedin.com/in/aborsu). Yes, finally after years of work at my place, I wanted to leave my house a bit during the week.
<br>
So, we decide to find a place to rent with a great womminuty to work with. After few searchs, we've found the [Betacowork](http://www.betacowork.com/) space in Etterbeek. Yes, like 5minutes walk from our acutal place! And like [Gus](https://be.linkedin.com/in/aborsu) said, 5minutes walk if we're slow.
<br>
We took some info from [Stefania Scognamiglio](http://www.betacowork.com/profile/?profile_id=851) on their website (instant chat) and we subscribe for a trial day the day after.
<br>
We started our day with a visit kindly done by [Sara Magnabosco](http://www.betacowork.com/profile/1610/sara-magnabosco/), after that, we sit with [Ramon Suarez](http://www.betacowork.com/profile/?profile_id=181) during his lunch (with the non-enought knowed spicy sauce :) ) and explained him our project. The place is quiet, lighty and the team that leads the project seems fun and proactive. Let's try then!
<br>
We choosed our local between the three availables (two "noisy" and a quiet one). We pick up a "noisy" (it means that you can skype there or receive a phone call) and seriously, I'm sure I am more noisy when I sleep, so it's really confortable.

The first day was a great experience, we gain in productivity and I came back home workless. And this last one is really the plus of this solution.
